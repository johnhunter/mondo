# Mondo

A simple react template.

A lighter alternative to Create React App using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for its leverage of ES module support in the browser and convention based approach. Testing uses [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

More complete templates will be created as branches.

## Prerequisites

### Node

The local environment assumes `node@18`. You can use any Node version manager that uses the `.nvmrc` configuration file (we recommend [fnm](https://fnm.vercel.app/)).
